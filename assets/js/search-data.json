If you do not have accounts, please create one and message `kpats` with the details.\n\n## Setting up your workspace\n\n1. Clone the dendronhq workspace: `git@github.com:dendronhq/org-workspace.git`\n\n   - this will pull down two more vaults\n     - org-private: company specific things (eg. standup, priorities, etc)\n     - org-dev: dev specific things (eg. deployment, qa, operations, etc)\n   - you can see what we've been working on under `user.{name}.journal.*` hierarchies\n\n1. Use the `Vault Add` command to add the following remote vaults\n   - endpoint: https://github.com/dendronhq/handbook\n   - endpoint: https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site\n   - NOTE: we currently have to do this because these are [workspace vaults](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html#workspace-vault). Dendron doesn't add them automatically from the workspace file\n   - NOTE2: this also means that you shouldn't commit anything to the `org-workspace`until this is resolved\n1. After adding the remote vaults, use `Configure(yaml)` and change the visibility of `dendron-site` and `handbook` to `private` (see example below)\n   ```yml\n   - \n     fsPath: repos/handbook/handbook\n     name: handbook\n     visibility: private\n   ```\n   - NOTE: we need to do this because we want meaningful commit messages for these repositories. setting them to private will prevent [workspace sync](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/23a1b942-99af-45c8-8116-4f4bb7dccd21.html#sync) from auto syncing them\n\n## Company Values\n\nTake a moment to read the `handbook.company*` notes. Especially the following sections:\n\n- [[Mission|handbook.company.mission]]\n- [[Values|handbook.company.values]]\n\n## Getting context\n\nYou can get caught up on what we're working on recently by reviewing the [[weekly|handbook.map#weekly]] hierarchy.\n\nYou can see our annual goals as a company in the [[yearly|handbook.map#yearly]] hierarchy.\n\nYou can also look at individual [[user|handbook.map#user]] hierarchies to see the day to day tasks.\n\n## Doing your first task\n\nAt this point, you can get started by picking off a good first task from our backlog. You can find our coding guidelines, how to setup Dendron and a list of good first tasks [here](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/81da87be-2d4e-47b5-a1d6-c0d647e1ab00.html).\n\n## Workflow\n\nUse the workspace commands to keep your repository in sync\n\n```sh\n# add . && commit all vaults\ndendron workspace addAndCommit\n\n# pull --rebase all vaults\ndendron workspace pull\n\n# push all vaults\ndendron workspace push\n\n# run all the commands above\ndendron workspace sync\n```\n\n### Merge Conflicts\n\nWhen you run `workspace sync`, you might get a merge conflict since others could have edited the file. This is expected and use your best sense when resolving the merge conflict.\n\nThe typical workflow:\n\n```sh\ndendron workspace sync\n# discover merge conflict\n# fix merge conflict\n# run the folloing on the bad file\ngit add && git commit && git push\n# re-run sync\ndendron workspace sync\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Make sure you have access to the code: [[Code|dendron://private/pro]]\n- Now that you have access to the company vaults, copy the [[Checklist |handbook.people.onboarding.checklist]] over to your own user.<alias> hierarchy and get started on that.\n","url":"https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/09a34445-345d-42c9-b82b-6f6691aed668.html","relUrl":"notes/09a34445-345d-42c9-b82b-6f6691aed668.html"},{"doc":"Checklist","title":"Checklist","hpath":"handbook.people.onboarding.checklist","content":"\n## Welcome to Dendron!\n\nWe are so excited you’re here and look forward to setting you up for remote-first success as your journey begins. Copy this onboarding checklist to user.{alias}.onboarding in the private vault and work through the tasks over the course of your first 30 days. If any task doesn't make sense, please reach out to the team on discord. **Note:** We're really appreciative of Gitlab pioneering the space of remote work and have included a lot of links to the Gitlab handbook. The wealth of information in this note can be overwhelming at times. It's okay to skim through resources, bookmark them and come back at a later time.\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n- Day 1: [Getting Started: Accounts and Paperwork](#day-1-getting-started-accounts-and-paperwork)\n- Day 2: [Morning: Remote Working and our Values](#day-2-remote-working-and-our-values)\n- Day 3: [Morning: Social](#day-3-social)\n- Day 4: [Morning: Git](#day-4-git)\n- [Job Specific Tasks](#job-specific-tasks)\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis is your core onboarding issue and it is housed in Dendron in the interests of what is known as [dogfooding](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#dogfooding). It has been crafted with the [three dimensions of remote onboarding](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/onboarding/) in mind, namely: Organizational Onboarding, Technical Onboarding and Social Onboarding.\n\nAll three of these are underpinned by the sentiments of [lifelong learning](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#lifelong-learning), while encouraging [asynchronous communication and workflows](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/).\n\n### Support and our Single Source of Truth\n\nSince Dendron aspires to be a [handbook first](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/) organization, the answer to question you may have particularly throughout your first thirty days should be documented and readily available in the [handbook](http://handbook.dendron.so). If you are unable to find the information you are looking for, please reach out on the #dendron-team channel in Discord and update the handbook once you find the answer.\n\n### The First Thirty Days\n\nThis note consists of a series of tasks which should be completed sequentially over the course of the next thirty days structured as follows:\n\n| Day         | Area of Focus                                |\n| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| **Day 01**  | Accounts; Applications and Paperwork         |\n| **Day 02**  | Remote Work; Communication and Values        |\n| **Day 03**  | Organizational Structure and Social Elements |\n| **Day 04**  | Introduction to Dendron and using Github     |\n| **Day 05+** | Explore (Various)                            |\n\nThough you may be eager to jump right into your role we encourage you to set aside dedicated time every day for your first week to focus on these tasks as they are geared toward ensuring you are enabled to [thrive in an all-remote environment](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/onboarding/#the-importance-of-onboarding).\n\n### Continuous Improvement\n\nIn the interests of paying it forward and contributing to our core value of [Iteration](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#iteration) - we encourage you to suggest changes and updates to this note and the handbook, both of which can be done via Pull Request (PR).\n\nAlong with this you will complete onboarding on Day Thirty by being asked to fill out the [Onboarding Satisfaction Survey](TODO), which is an opportunity to share feedback on your general Onboarding Experience.\n\n---\n\n### Before Starting at Dendron\n\n<details>\n<summary>Manager</summary>\n\n1. [ ] Check to see if the new hire's Rippling onboard has been completed, if not send out a reminder.\n1. [ ] Schedule a Zoom video call with the new team member for the start of their first day to welcome them to the team and set expectations. Send them an invitation to their personal email. The team members Dendron email address will only be activated on their first day. You can find their personal email address on Rippling.\n1. [ ] Send an email to the new team member's personal email address welcoming them to Dendron. Provide them with a link to this note to help with a great first day experience.\n1. [ ] Read through Gitlab's [Building Trust Handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/building-trust/).\n1. [ ] Organize a smooth onboarding plan with clear starting tasks and pathway for new team member (copy this note for the team member as a starting point)\n1. [ ] Review and add any Job-specific tasks to this note. Complete any manager tasks and coordinate with kpats@ if any changes are needed.\n\n### Google account\n\n1.  [ ] Log on to the [Google Admin console](https://admin.google.com/ac/users) and verify the chosen email address is not conflicting with a current account. Then assign the email to team meber and add the email address to [Rippling](https://app.rippling.com/dashboard) in the work email field.\n\n### Accounts and Access\n\n1. [ ] Add the team members to the `Dendron Team` role in Discord. This will give them access to the relevant channels.\n1. [ ] Invite team member to recurring team meetings, consider pressing `don't send`, this will reduce noise in their inbox on day 1.\n1. [ ] Schedule weekly [1:1 meetings](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/1-1/) with new team member. Use the first 15 minutes to get to know your new team member on a personal level.\n1. [ ] Set new team member's Github group and project-level permissions as needed.\n</details>\n\n### Day 1 - Getting Started: Accounts and Paperwork\n\n<details>\n<summary>New Team Member</summary>\n\n#### Rpass\n\n1. [ ] :red_circle: Install rpass. Dendron provides all team members with an account to rpass to help manage work credentials.\n\n   - [ ] Detailed instructions TBD.\n\n   #### 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)\n\n1. [ ] Dendron requires you to enable 2FA (2-Step Verification, also known as two-factor authentication), because it adds an extra layer of security to your account. You sign in with something you know (your password) and something you have (a code you can copy from your Virtual Multi-Factor authentication Device, like [Authy](https://authy.com), FreeOTP, or Google Authenticator). Please make sure that time is set automatically on your device (ie. on Android: \"Settings\" > \"Date & Time\" > \"Set automatically\"). If you have problems with 2FA just let the team know! We can disable it for you to then set it up again. Reach out proactively if you're struggling - it's better than getting locked out and needing to wait for IT Ops to help you get back online.\n1. [ ] :red_circle: Do the next 3 steps Today. Actually -- why not RIGHT NOW. This absolutely must be done within a week or you will be locked out and need to wait for an admin to get around to helping you get reconnected.\n   1. [ ] :red_circle: Enable 2FA on your Dendron email account (Gmail/GSuite) (this should have been an option to do when you first received the invitation to the account).\n   1. [ ] :red_circle: Enable [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication) on your Github account.\n\n##### Rippling\n\n**_This section is super important to ensure payroll + operations support. Please complete these items on your first day if possible._**\n\n1. [ ] Rippling is our HRIS (Human Resource Information System) for all team members. We have self-service enabled so that at any time you can access your account to see your employment information and documentation. As part of onboarding, please make sure to update everything that is applicable to you.\n   1. [ ] Access the Rippling [Dashboard](https://app.rippling.com) and make sure you complete any outstanding tasks assigned to you.\n   1. [ ] For contractors being paid by the hour, it may be useful to save an invoice template for future use. An invoice template can be found in Google Docs by searching `Invoice Template` or [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1faslC4H_NSLsk8jd8xUuwgAjqhkdSlaI0D1WINA1y9Y/edit#gid=0).\n1. [ ] Don't forget to comply with the contract you signed, and make sure you understand [Intellectual Property](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/code-of-conduct/#intellectual-property-and-protecting-ip).\n\n##### Discord\n\n1. [ ] Register on Discord by following this [invitation link](https://discord.gg/xrKTUStHNZ). Read the next suggestions on how to choose a username first.\n1. [ ] You can use your personal discord OR choose to create a new username using your Dendron email. It's generally helpful to choose a username to be the same as your Github handle, for consistency and ease of use.\n   1. [ ] At Dendron [Transparency](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#transparencyy) is a value and we prefer to use Public channels in Discord. Continue to use public channels wherever possible (`#dev`), especially if it is a work related discussion (you may be surprised by the feedback you get from the community).\n   1. Make sure your Discord profile has a **photo** - it makes it easier for other team members to remember you!\n   1. We love to hear more, such as where you were before, family/pets, and hobbies.\n   1. We also enjoy pictures if you're willing to share. Consider giving your new team members a glimpse into your world (scroll through previous messages in the channel for inspiration).\n1. [ ] If you're new to Discord, a short primer can be found at\n       [a Beginner's guide to Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Day 2 - Remote Working and our Values\n\n<details>\n<summary>New Team Member</summary>\n\n### Remote Work\n\n1. [ ] The first month at a remote company can be hard. **There is as much to unlearn as there is to learn**. Gitlab's a pioneer in this regard and have put together a great set of tips and tricks that will help. You can view their entire course listed below.\n1. [ ] Particularly if you're new to working in a 100% remote environment, read over the [Guide for starting a new remote role](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/getting-started/). You'll find other tips for operating (and thriving!) in an all-remote setting within the [All-Remote section of the Gitlab handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/). Take some inspiration from the folks at Gitlab on how they structure their remote working day, read this helpful blog post [A day in the life of remote worker](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/06/18/day-in-the-life-remote-worker/)\n1. - [ ] Learn more about the `#allremote` onboarding process and additional [best practices](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/learning-and-development/#how-do-you-onboard-new-team-members).\n   - [Adopting a Self-Service and Self-Learning Mentality Knowledge Assessment](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/self-service/#introduction)\n     (Day 1)\n   - [Informal Communication in an All-Remote Environment Knowledge Assessment](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication)\n   - [Embrace Asynchronous Communication](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous)\n   - [ ] [All-Remote Meetings](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/meetings)\n   - [Communicating Effectively and Responsibly Through Text](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/meetings/#how-do-you-do-all-remote-meetings-right)\n   - [ ] [Building and Reinforcing a Sustainable Culture Knowledge Assessment](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/building-culture/#gitlab-knowledge-assessment-building-and-reinforcing-a-sustainable-culture)\n   - [ ] [Combating Burnout, Isolation, and Anxiety in the Remote Workplace](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health)\n   - [ ] [The Non-Linear Workday](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/non-linear-workday)\n\n### Values\n\n1. [ ] Dendron values are a living document. Familiarize yourself with our [Values page](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/#introduction).\n1. [ ] We are driven by our mission - to help people organize and make sense of their information. Read our [mission statement](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/8989a93d-8dde-4a51-bb8d-2aad761c93a1.html) for more details.\n\n### Calendar\n\n#### Set Up\n\n1. [ ] Set your Google Calendar [default event duration](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings) to use `speedy meetings`\n1. [ ] Set up [Calendly](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/other-apps/#sts=Calendly). Calendly is a calendar tool that allows individuals to select open meeting slots in order to speak with others outside of Dendron. For Dendron team members, feel free to schedule directly through Google calendar. When you are setting up Calendly, there is no specific Dendron account. With the free version you will only be allowed one meeting time, but if you need to upgrade to a Pro account, you can do so and expense it.\n1. [ ] Add the Zoom integration by going to the `Integrations` section at the top of the page. Find Zoom in the list of integrations and click it. It will then ask you to link your Calendly and Zoom accounts together. Do so.\n1. [ ] Now make Zoom the default event location by editing each 'Event type' in Calendly (By default, there should be a `15 Minute Meeting`, `30 Minute Meeting` and `60 Minute Meeting` event types) by clicking the gear icon associated with each event type then going to `Edit`. Click on `What event is this?` and under `Location` choose Zoom. Click on `Save and Close`, and do this for each remaining event type.\n1. [ ] [Set your working hours & availability](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en) in your Google Calendar.\n\n#### Events\n\nOn your calendar, you will have a invites to the below meetings, they are\noptional, but you are highly encouraged to attend. Please note: These meetings\nmay not fall during your first week.\n\n1. Weekly planning sync. This is where the team reviews goals accomplished during the last week and picks up on what should be done this week to be successful.\n\n#### Your Role\n\n- Spend the rest of your day doing your Role-based tasks (see the Job-specific tasks at the end of this issue and in your assigned role-based onboarding issue, as applicable).\n\n</details>\n\n### Day 3 - Social\n\n<details>\n<summary>New Team Member</summary>\n   \n1. [ ] Create and add your own [README](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/digital-experience/website/#creating-and-publishing-your-gitlab-readme). This may take some time to create so please feel free to iterate on it once you get some details in to your user.<name> hierarchy in Dendron.\n\n#### Social media + Expenses\n\n- [ ] Connect with or follow Dendron's social media sites:\n      [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dendron-so/),\n      [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dendronhq),\n      [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GQLj4KZhN8WcJPiKXtcRQ).\n- [ ] Familiarize yourself with our [[expense report process|dendron.sop.expensing]] and bookmark the [link](https://airtable.com/shrtJd0sitnY6Bfre) to expensing stuff.\n\n#### Your Role\n\n- Spend the rest of your day doing your Role-based tasks (see the Job-specific\n  tasks at the end of this issue and in your assigned role-based onboarding\n  issue, as applicable).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Day 4 - Dendron + Github\n\n<details>\n<summary>New Team Member</summary>\n\nFor those new to Github and Dendron, it's important to get familiar with the below and [bookmark these links](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/self-service/)\n\n#### General Breakdown\n\n1. [ ] Read how devs can [contribute](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/81da87be-2d4e-47b5-a1d6-c0d647e1ab00.html) to Dendron.\n1. [ ] Read [this page](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/3489b652-cd0e-4ac8-a734-08094dc043eb.html) and all child pages for an overview of the Dendron Development Process\n\n##### Issues and Issue Trackers\n\n1. [ ] Learn how to use [Github Issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues). We use Github Issues to raise awareness, discuss, and propose solutions for various issues related to any aspect of our business. The most common issues are created in the following projects:\n   - [Dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues) - Issues related to\n     our main tool.\n   - [Dendron Site](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site/issues) - Issues related to documentation.\n1. [ ] Make an improvement to the [handbook](https://github.com/dendronhq/handbook). Being new, you may be unsure if your idea for a change is good or not, and that's OK!

Google organizes the world's information to make it accessible, but there's nothing that does that for personal or institutional information. If search worked in this case, google drive and google docs should be enough for note taking (but they're not). \n\nWe already have a way of managing information at scale. Big software projects are millions of lines of code, but developers are able to work through that complexity with IDEs (integrated development environments) that let them uniformly structure, update, and find specific areas of code. Dendron is taking those same concepts and applying it to general knowledge - we make it possible to enforce a consistent structure across thousands of documents so that you can always find what you need. \n","url":"https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/5c65d3b7-403c-49b2-8161-efb67a491dd2.html","relUrl":"notes/5c65d3b7-403c-49b2-8161-efb67a491dd2.html"},{"doc":"Values","title":"Values","hpath":"handbook.company.values","content":"\n## Summary\n\nThis page describes our values as a company. We are at our best when we operate with these values in mind.\n\n## Community Focused\n\nDendron wouldn't exist without our strong community. Our north star is meaningfully improving the lives of everyone who uses Dendron. The way we think about what to work on is guided by what would be best for our entire community.\n\n### In Practice\n\n- We provide personal onboardings for new users\n- We addressing questions and feedback in [discord](https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9) in near realtime\n- We adjusting and prioritize user feedback when planning our [roadmap](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html)\n\n## Lookup\n\nInstead of _not invented here_, we believe in _building on what already exists_. We actively seek to find order in the universe and add our node on top of what already exists.\n\n### In Practice\n\n- we use standard markdown where possible and expand where needed, with a focus on interoperability and portability\n- we based our values off our experience in past companies as well as places we admire\n\n## Pragmatism\n\nWe have high level goals but we are flexible in the details. At the end of the day we will do whatever it takes to help people make sense of the things that matter.\n\n### In Practice\n- We build Dendron on top of VSCode because it has widespread adoption and allows us to iterate quickly\n- We look to integrate with existing tools instead of replacing them using pods and interoperable standards\n\n## Ownership\n\nWe care about putting high quality, well thought through products out to customers. True artisans view products end-to-end and never sacrifice long-term reputational value for short-term results. We act on behalf of the entire team and community, beyond just our own focus area. We are not satisfied by the phrase “that’s not my job.”\n\n### In Practice\n\n- We prioritize entire customer scenarios over component areas.\n\n## Transparency\n\nWe work in the open. This means that we will be transaparent about what, how, and why we do things.\n\n### In Practice\n\n- We released Dendron as an open source product\n- We published our handbook for everyone to see\n- We publish our [roadmap](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html) on github\n\n## Iteration\n\nThe perfect is the enemy of the shipped. We strive to do great work but we will do it incrementally instead of waiting for something to be _perfect_. We prioritize ruthlessly, delivering the right things with the right quality in a timely fashion.\n\nIteration means that we will hit the deadline but are fleixble about the scope. It's okay and also encouraged to have multiple phases for any individual feature. \n\n### In Practice\n\n- We publish our work (eg. code, handbook, roadmap) in the process of working on it\n- We push out updates on a [weekly release cycle](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/932534e7-e788-4fdb-bc8c-eaf761992a8d.html)\n- We dedicate a `learnings` section to the end of every project to figure out how to improve the process for next time\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe look for virtuous cycles and long term growth in all that we do. This means we think about both the long term **benefits and costs** of the actions we take and invest in areas that will take many years to bear fruit\n\n### In Practice\n- We pay down technical debt by dedicating cycles to it every sprint\n- [[Lookup|handbook.company.values#lookup]] -> [[Iterate|handbook.company.values#iteration]] -> [[Learn|handbook.company.values#lifelong-learning]]\n\n## Passing It Forward\n\nWe leave things better than we found it. Code, knowledge, the world - we like to leave things so that the next person coming back do it will have a better way of starting.\n\n### In Practice\n- all important decisions and learnings are written down in the company handbook so everyone can benefit\n- We are collecting and indexing the worlds data in publically available vaults on [Personal Knowledge Management](https://pkm.dendron.so/), [AWS](https://aws.dendron.so/) and of course [XKCD](https://xkcd.dendron.so/)\n\n","url":"https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html","relUrl":"notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html"},{"doc":"Mission","title":"Mission","hpath":"handbook.company.mission","content":"\nOur mission is to help **people** organize and make sense of any amount of information.\n\nWe are doing this by building the [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for general knowledge.\n\nFrom day one, the words of Vannevar Bush, originator of the [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex), has been our north star\n\n> \"We are overwhelmed with information and we don't have the tools to properly index and filter through it.
